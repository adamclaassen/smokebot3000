Setting up your Pi for the robot is pretty easy.
1. Simply type `./setup.sh robotname` into your terminal, replacing robotname with your robot's name.
2. This will reboot your pi at the end, so wait for it to reboot and connect to the `robotname` WiFi network.
3. Type `http://robotname` into your browser (yes, you do need the http:// part this time)
4. Profit!
