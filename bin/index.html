		<p width=75% align="center">To enable the applet, you must first ensure that Java 8 is succesfully installed on your computer.
		Then, place the index.html file in the "project_folder/bin" directory. Then, you must go into 
		Control Panel/System Preferences -> Java -> Security and add either the URL "http://kangaroocg.com" if you're looking at the testing applet, or your Pi's IP address/hostname to your exception list. After doing so, allow the applet to run. </p>
